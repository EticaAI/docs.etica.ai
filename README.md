It's final objective is to catalog reliable translations in the Spanish and
Portuguese languages of reference documents. The topic of interest involves
responsible application of automation and artificial intelligence.

### Documents to be added soon
We are looking for reliable versions of reference documents in Spanish and
Portuguese and, if this is not possible, we will use the original versions.
